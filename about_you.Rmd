### my answer     
  
I went to Rosamond high school and yes I did graduate I just graduated in July. English and math are two complete different subjects but you need both in life I say the math teachers are more fun in math than in english. Math was easier to me because of how helping the teacher was when I had a question.The subject I did best in was econ in my opinion.
